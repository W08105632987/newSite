                            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                            <p>MonieKing was founded in Bwari, Abuja, by Mr. Kenneth (Director of Wizzellard Concept) and Mr. Joshua (Director of Joshline Fund Management). Two entrepreneurs from different backgrounds united by a common vision: bringing practical banking and savings solutions closer to local communities.</p>
                            <p>At a time when many Nigerians faced major challenges accessing reliable cash services, fair savings options, and affordable credit, we set out to answer three critical questions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How do we bring banking services closer to everyday people?</li>
                                <li>How do we offer reliable, quality cash services without stress?</li>
                                <li>How do we help people save and access loans conveniently, without excessive charges?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="timeline-content">
                            <h3>Building Trust from the Ground Up</h3>
                            <p>We started as a POS-driven cash services business, strategically placing POS points within communities to ensure customers could withdraw cash anytime. Beyond cash dispensing, we supported customers with structured savings, including community-focused food contribution packs.</p>
                            <p>The early years weren't easy. Fake contribution schemes were widespread, and many people had suffered financial losses. Trust was fragile. What sustained us was <strong>consistency</strong> — showing up every day, physically present at business locations, identifiable through customized branded shirts, and always available to customers.</p>
                            <p>Savings were paid out reliably, including agreed returns, and commitments were honored without excuses. Over time, people began to notice the difference. <strong>Trust grew — not through marketing promises, but through visible presence, reliability, and consistency.</strong></p>

                            <p>As trust deepened, we expanded our services to meet growing community needs. We secured our first major aggregator partnership with <strong>OPay</strong>, followed by <strong>Paga</strong>, significantly strengthening our infrastructure and credibility.</p>
                            <p>Our services expanded to include:</p>

                            <p>We explored digital expansion through an early app development initiative, gaining valuable insights that shaped our future strategy. Despite industry-wide disruptions — including Nigeria's cashless policy era — MonieKing remained resilient, adapted quickly, and continued to serve customers without interruption.</p>

                            <p>We launched our most ambitious project yet: a cooperative savings fintech application (CoopHub), developed in collaboration with <strong>Wema Bank</strong>. This marked our strategic shift toward full digital transformation and formal cooperative operations.</p>
                            <p>We officially adopted the cooperative model, recognizing it as the structure that best aligns with our core values:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Members are stakeholders, not just users</li>
                                <li>Savings structured for long-term financial discipline</li>
                                <li>Profits shared transparently through annual dividends</li>
                                <li>Fair access to loans at minimal interest (5%)</li>
                                <li>Collective strength replaces individual vulnerability</li>
                            </ul>
